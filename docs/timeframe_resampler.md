# TimeframeResampler: current behavior map

This note describes the current repository behavior as implemented today.

## Where resampling is wired

- Resampling implementation lives in `src/bt/data/resample.py` (`TimeframeResampler`).
- Strategy context injection uses `HTFContextStrategyAdapter` in `src/bt/strategy/htf_context.py`, which calls `resampler.update(bar)` for each incoming symbol bar at each engine timestamp and places only *newly closed* HTF bars in `ctx["htf"]`.
- Construction path is `_build_engine` in `src/bt/api.py`:
  - it reads `config["htf_resampler"]` when present,
  - instantiates `TimeframeResampler(timeframes=..., strict=...)`,
  - wraps strategy with `HTFContextStrategyAdapter`.
- Legacy config aliasing into `htf_resampler` is normalized in `src/bt/core/config_resolver.py` via `htf_timeframes` / `htf_strict`.

## Input assumptions

- Input is assumed to be **1-minute UTC bars only** (`base_freq="1min"` required).
- Non-UTC or tz-naive bar timestamps raise assertions.
- No support for non-1m base feed in current implementation.

## Bucket boundaries and timestamp semantics

- Bucket start is computed with UTC floor semantics (`ts.floor(...)`).
  - Minute-based timeframes use `floor("{N}min")`.
  - `1h` uses `floor("1h")`.
  - `1d` uses `floor("1d")`.
- Emitted `HTFBar.ts` is the **bucket start timestamp** (not bucket close).

## Emission timing, strict mode, and completeness

- Resampler is streaming/event-driven: each `update(bar)` can emit zero or more HTF bars.
- A bucket is finalized only when a bar from a *new* bucket arrives (`bucket_start` changes).
- Completeness checks:
  - `expected_bars` = timeframe length in minutes.
  - `n_bars` = number of 1m bars observed in the bucket.
  - any intra-bucket timestamp jump > 1 minute marks bucket incomplete.
  - final completeness is `not is_incomplete and n_bars == expected_bars`.
- In strict mode (`strict=True`), incomplete buckets are **suppressed** (not emitted).
- There is no forced final flush at end-of-data by the resampler itself; only closed buckets observed at a boundary transition can emit.

## Gap policy / no interpolation

- Missing input minutes are not fabricated.
- Gaps mark bucket incomplete (strict mode then drops that bucket).
- No interpolation/backfill/synthetic bars are created.

## Engine ordering and no-lookahead interaction

- Engine loop pulls one timestamp slice from feed and calls strategy exactly once per timestamp.
- HTF adapter runs inside `strategy.on_bars(...)` and processes only currently available base bars.
- Because HTF bars emit only on bucket rollover (arrival of the first bar of next bucket), strategies never see an HTF bucket before it is closed.
- `ctx["htf"]` includes only newly emitted bars for the current engine timestamp, not future buckets.

## Potential lookahead pitfalls if misused

- Using *current, in-progress* bucket values outside this adapter (not done here) could introduce lookahead.
- Treating `HTFBar.ts` as close-time instead of open-time can cause alignment mistakes.
- Disabling strict mode in future implementations must still avoid exposing unclosed future data.

## New config knob: `data.timeframe`

- `data.timeframe` now provides a single run-level target timeframe override for HTF resampling.
- Supported values: `1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`.
- Behavior:
  - when set, it overrides `htf_resampler.timeframes` with a single-element list `[data.timeframe]` at engine build time,
  - if `htf_resampler` was absent, it creates one with strict mode enabled,
  - if unset, behavior is unchanged from previous wiring.
- It controls HTF context resample target used by the existing adapter path.
- It does **not** modify engine loop timing/clock semantics in `src/bt/core/engine.py`.

### Example override

```yaml
data:
  timeframe: "15m"
```
